# Abstract
<Traditional diets in African communities are rapidly being replaced by Western-style diets, with the health consequences not well understood. In young urban and rural men from Northern Tanzania, we investigated the immune and metabolic effects of switching between traditional (TD) and Western (WD) diets for two weeks, and consuming a traditional fermented banana beverage ('Mbege') for one week. Using functional immune assays (cytokine production capacity) and omics assays (proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics), changes in the immune and metabolic system were assessed before and after the intervention, and at four-week follow-up. Transitioning from TD to WD impacted different metabolic pathways and promoted a pro-inflammatory state at the level of circulating leukocytes, plasma proteins, and gene expression. In contrast, switching from WD to TD or consuming the fermented beverage had a largely anti-inflammatory effect. Some of the observed changes in the immune and metabolic profiles persisted at follow-up, suggesting a lasting impact from the short-term intervention. These findings provide novel insights into the health effects associated with dietary transitions and the consumption of traditional fermented beverages. They emphasize the importance of preserving indigenous dietary practices and highlight the central role of dietary changes in the rapidly growing burden of non-communicable diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa.>
